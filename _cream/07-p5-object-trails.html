description: 'Next, I wanted to shift from drawing the particles and their current positions to drawing the paths along which the particles had moved. With this visual shift, I also imagined a conceptual shift in my mental model. Specifically, I was now thinking about each initial particle as a packet of particles, representing many, many tiny, tiny particles that are all being swept along the same path. The trail left behind represents particles left behind, along the path, because they were moving more slowly to start, or for some other reason. They were mixing into the coffee and leaving a creamy hue in their wake. I could imagine encoding this conceptual shift further in my model by adjusting the path''s opacity and width to demonstrate the particles left along a path are less dense and continue to diffuse in place. But one step at a time.
