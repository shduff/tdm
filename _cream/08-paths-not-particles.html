title: paths not particles
author: shaunalynn
description: 'I took the logic with which #7 drew object trails, and begin to incorporate it into the much more complex structure of my growing Particle System. I created a list to keep track of all the points a particle had gone to, so I could recreate its path. Then, I replaced the function I used to draw the particle with one to draw a path connecting the history of points I was collecting in my list. 
<br><br>
Looking at paths instead of particles, I also decidedd to add the aesthetic factors of width and opacity, to try and capture some of the more symbolic effects I''d been dreaming about in #7. And, all in all, it looked pretty good! I could see the promise here! There was a problem, though. This new approach was slowing things down in a major way, so much so that testing things was taking forever and getting pretty frustrating. I had to tackle the timing problem next.'
