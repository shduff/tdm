description: 'OK, so I first decided to tackle the fact that coffee and cream are made of particles. My first mental model was to have two different types of molecules, but I decided to start with just one, the cream molecules, letting the background represent the coffee. Eventually, I might want to include both, especially to model things like heat transfer, but one type of particle seemed like enough to start out with.<br><br>With that insight in mind, I also knew I wanted to work forward from some kind of existing framework. I did a bit of googling and brainstorming and found <a href="http://p5js.org">p5.js</a>, which seemed appealing. I wanted to use this system so I would be able to jump straight into the work of modeling without having to use a ton of time and energy familiarizing myself with p5.js and building out the whole particle structure myself.<br><br>This is a code snippet offered within p5.js''s reference materials to get you started with a basic particle system. I was on my way...'
