title: diffusing particles
author: shaunalynn
description: 'Finally, diffusion! For this program, I kept <i>everything</i> the same, except the step-size of the particle. In this way, I tweaked the ratio of the particle and step size. With the step-size decreased to 2, and the program drawing a new particle every time the frame is redrawn (until it hits 150 particles, to avoid lag), this program is my model of diffusion. Here are 150 cream particles, diffusing through the not-modeled-here coffee particles. 
<br><br>
The particle''s random walks assume they are the exact same temperature and acidity as the coffee, that there are no differences that would quicken or slow the diffusive force. There are no edges to the coffee, <i>i.e.</i> no sides to the coffee cup, so we never get to see when the two are fully mixed. The cream simply materializes in the middle of the coffee, meaning there is no pouring or other disturbance to the perfect, random paths.

There is obviously more work to do here...'
