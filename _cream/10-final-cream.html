description: 'Finally, I had a working system! I incorporated Alec''s logic to solve the delay problem. I pulled out all the program variables and defined them aat the top so I could easily mess around and try mix and matching all different kinds of parameters, which was kind of the point. I added in some logic and variables so that temperature difference between the coffee and cream would affect the diffusive force. As the cream mixes, and the temperature difference decreases, the diffusive force also decreases. I added a variable for the "water resistance" of the coffee. And, lastly, I made some aesthetic decisions around color and allowed you to mess around with how quickly the width and opacity of the cream paths decreased.
<br><br>
Tada! Here it is. There are so many things I could still add to this program, the biggest lift of which would be actually calibrating it to real world values, but the creation of this model definitely got me thinking about how mixing and diffusion work and how multiple forces, simple to express and model in isolation, combine to create something much more complex.'
