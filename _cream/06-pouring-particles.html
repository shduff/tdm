title: pouring particles
author: shaunalynn
description: 'The particles in this program are still diffusing at all times, but they are now being moved by gravity (an constant, downward acceleration) as well as an initial downward velocity (from bring poured). In addition to this, there is an impact effect. When particles collide with the cup''s bottom or sides, or when they hit the surface of the coffee itself, they lose some amount of their velocity and have the remaining portion of that velocity redirected in the direction it''s most likely they would move. 
<br><br>
This model now includes not only the tiny, random movements of diffusion at the molecular level, but also the macro-movements of gravity, pouring, and collisions. At this point, however, there is still more to do. The cream particles somehow seem to heavy, or dense. They fall to the bottom of the cup without mixing into the coffee in any way. 
<br><br>
There are still some conceptual additions I''d like to make to this model, but I think some of these problems might also be solved aesthetically. Where to next?'
