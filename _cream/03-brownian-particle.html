description: 'And I found success pretty quickly. Here is a single particle, generated using the Particle System from #1 adapted to update its position using the same logic laid out in the Random Walk from #2. Looking under the hood of this random walk showed me that, rather than implementing a perfectly random walk, one in which the particle might move to any point within a certain distance from its current point, this snippet actually limited the particles movements to the cardinal directions: up, down, left, and right.
<br><br>
As long as the particle continues to take small steps, as it is here (with a step-size of 5) and as it is in #2 (with a step-size of 1), the particle appears to move randomly. If you think about it, this makes sense, since thing moving a little bit up and then right and then up and then right, appears to make a line that moves up and to the right. By keeping the step-size small, we are able to aapproximate slanted lines and more complex curves simply by moving horizontally and vertically.'
