		<p>From religious glows like the halo, the sacred heart of Christ, and the burning bush to the secular use of glow in lightsabers and monoliths, heroes heading into the sunset, and the trope of <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerGlows">Power Glows</a>, I'm interested in glow because of its emotional impact and symbolic meaning. Inspired by Vi Hart's <a href="http://vihart.com/fifty-fizzbuzzes/">Fifty Fizzbuzzes</a> and Rosalie Norris' <a href="https://www.notion.so/powderhouse/Tiny-Digital-Masterpieces-96d5d2c001e24ecfac1a8334d52d5b1b">Tiny Digital Masterpieces</a>, 50 Glows is a collection of glow effects implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These effects are at once an exploration of glow as an expression of the sacred and of the Fifty Fizzbuzzes form as a structure for pushing creative problem solving and coding skills development. It is at the intersection of these two projects that 50 Glows is situated. I want to push myself to expand and make more explicit my coding skills while beginning an exploration of objects which centers the ecstatic.</p>

		<p>At the center of 50 Glows is an object I love and experience as a kind of talisman or token through which I can connect with the ecstatic: Chuckanucka. Objects are a central elements of ecstatic rituals. As props, set pieces, costume elements, idols, and symbols, they bring people together around shared meaning. They externalize ideas and beliefs in physical form. In Go With The Glow, I will create a world in which ecstatic objects—starting with my own favorite stuffed animal, Chuckanucka—can be lit up, held up, amplified, celebrated, glorified through digital glow effects which run the gamut from playful to formal, cartoonish to square. This project places him in 50 digital situations in which his sacredness to me is made visible to others, amplified through the digital glows I apply to different effects.</p>

		<p>Feel free to poke around and explore these many expressions of Chuckanucka as well as some of the descriptive narrative capturing my process in designing and implementing each of these effects. Enjoy!</p>
