			<p>In this first masterpiece, I wanted to try and capture an "implied" movement, per Rosalie's descriptions of movement in her program of study. I was thinking about how to capture the effect of going into the light, being overcome by light, or even the effect when you take a photo or video and are backlit and you become a profile or shapeless shadow, X-Files-style. I wanted to take a picture that already had this effect and amplify it, growing the light to overtake the rest of the image.</p>
			<p> I really like this picture of Kris and I, and I wanted to implement this effect. The things I really wanted to do was to identify where the lights were in the picture, having whiteness grow outward from each light source into a single mass to take over the picture, "eating" us from the outer edge inwards. I didn't know hot to implement this, so I wound up doing a two phase process.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>I duplicated the picture, removing the background of one, layering the two versions with the background-less photo in the back. Then, by decreasing the opacity of the front photo it appears the background is being overtaken by light as the white background fades into view/the backgrounded photo fades out. This pretty successfully captured the whiteness growing outward as a single mass."</li>
				<li>I then decreased the opacity of the remaining picture, making sure to wait until the first opacity change was done, to simulate the overtaking of our bodies by the light. This failed to capture the effect of the light eating us from the outer edges, as our whole bodies faded out at the same rate.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>I learned *a lot* about the glowing effect that was in my mind. In a certain way, I see "the glow effect" as a manifestation of the angelic voices that often play when someone ironically or melodramatically or in all earnestness bestows something unto someone else. It's a formal, or faux formal, expression of godliness, of sacredness, that something should be seen as a spiritual object of some kind. I like that it is both earnest and joking. That it reminds me of church (think baptism or communion or the handing of the ring at a wedding) and of the X Files (think government agents in Hazmat suits on a hill in the woods backlit by undefined white lights from behind). This is all conception, but I also learned that I implicitly knew a lot more about the physicality of "the glow effect" as well. I knew that it started from the outside of an object and ate its way in or else emenated from an object and took over the entire scene. It didn't just fade away an object or scene in a linear fashion the way both of my attempts at the effect did. It has an origin.</p>

			<p>For this one, I wanted to create an actual movement. I found this photo of a CD by a former bandmate and knew I wanted to Kenny-G-ify it right away. I knew the opening sax line from Careless Whisper had to make an appearance, and that I wanted to zoom in to the strangely pixelated and other-worldly silhouette on the album cover, then begin rocking in an irregular way, trying to capture the way many musicians do when they are lost in the music-making process. Eyes closed, somewhat disembodied, often even out-of-time to the music they are creating. I knew capturing that movement exactly would be a large-scale project, requiring that I cut up and move separate parts of the sax player separately. Instead, I wanted to use a motion that suggested that movement. I decided to try zooming in and then rocking back and forth. While I wasn't going to articulate the sax player at the hips or neck the way the actual movement would require, I thought, if I zoomed in enough, the other-worldliness plus the heavy handed musical choice, might evoke the movement I had in my mind. It would at least be worth the first pancake-style experiment. So, I gave it a go, and here is the result. Click to activate.</p>
