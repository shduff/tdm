title: Flickering Candle
description: While imagining fire, I couldn't help but think about another installation piece I'd seen at Mass MOCA more than a decade ago. In this installation, called <a href="https://massmoca.org/event/spencer-finch-what-time-is-it-on-the-sun/">What time is it on the sun?</a>, Spencer Finch uses a series of stained glass window panes to recreate the light quality of a room being lit by a flickering candle. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/candle.jpg"> He tried to create the color and effect exactly. In this glow effect, I wasn't so exacting, but I wanted to capture the essence of a candle flicker. Continuing to build on my control and use of the gradient, I used a radial—rather than linear—gradient, introducing a series of colors reflecting those I'd used to create the flame in <a href="../22">Glow 22</a>. Here is a simple representation of a candle (not pictured) flickering against a wall.
