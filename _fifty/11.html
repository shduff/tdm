title: Exploding Star
description: Revisiting the circle in <a href="../10">Glow 10</a> got me thinking about other shapes that symbolize or create glowing. Stars! Creating an HTML/CSS star, it turns out, is <a href="http://basicuse.net/articles/pl/textile/html_css/how_to_draw_stars_using_only_css">no small task</a>. Of course, I could download an image of a star, but part of my goal with this project was to tackle problems I didn't know how to tackle, and this was one. In this effect, I wanted to place a star behind the object, spinning like a ninja star and growing until it filled the background. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/ninja.gif"> I implemented the effect by drawing multiple triangles to form a star. The effect I wound up with is a star that spins out from behind the object, growing and moving back to center in a kind of lasso-like path. It works, but not as I'd hoped. I'd like to return to this effect before all is said and done and get the spinning effect I had originally imagined. <b>TK</b>
