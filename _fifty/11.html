title: Exploding Star
description: Revisiting the circle in <a href="../10">Glow 10</a> got me thinking about other shapes that symbolize or create glowing. Stars! Creating an HTML/CSS star, it turns out, is <a href="http://basicuse.net/articles/pl/textile/html_css/how_to_draw_stars_using_only_css">no small task</a>. Of course, I could download an image of a star, but part of my goal with this project was to tackle problems I didn't know how to tackle, and this was one. In this effect, I wanted to place a star behind the object, spinning like a ninja star and growing until it filled the background. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/ninja.gif"> I implemented the effect by drawing multiple triangles to form a star. The effect I wound up with is a star that spins out from behind the object, growing and moving back to center in a kind of lasso-like path. It works, but not as I'd hoped. I'd like to return to this effect before all is said and done and get the spinning effect I had originally imagined. <b>TK</b>

<style>

	/*Set the background of the page to black.*/
	body {
		background-color:black;
	}
	/*For any element with the id "object"*/
	#object {
		/*Elements with larger z-indexes are "on top of" elements with smaller z-indexes.*/
		z-index:10;
	}
	/*For any element with the class "glow"*/
	.glow {
		/*This z-index value means elements with class="glow" (z-index=5) will be "behind" elements with id="object" (z-index=10).*/
		z-index:5;
		/*To make the star shape, you first set the size of the div to be 0*/
		width: 0;
		height: 0;
		/*Then, you create a wide border on three sides. For the two sides opposite each other, you make them the same size and transparent.*/
		border-left: 75px solid transparent;
		border-right: 75px solid transparent;
		/*For the central side, you make it twice as large as the others and assign it a color.*/
		border-bottom: 150px solid yellow;
		/*Overall, this has the effect of creating a yellow triangle.*/
	}
	/*Then, you create a pseudo-element within any element with the class "glow" using the :after selector in CSS */
	.glow:after {		
		/*You set its position to be absolute within its class="glow" parent*/
		position: absolute;
		/*Then you give it the same parameters as the ones you gave its parent*/
		width: 0;
		height: 0;
		top: 50px;
		left: -75px;
		border-left: 75px solid transparent;
		border-right: 75px solid transparent;
		border-top: 150px solid yellow;
		/*Excepting a z-index, which it inherits from its parent, and including an empty "content" property, which is specific for pseudo-elements.*/
		content: "";
		/*This pseudo-element becomes another yellow triangle which, when placed on top of the .glow element, creates a six-pointed star. I was introduced to this approach by this article describing how to create stars using CSS: https://basicuse.net/articles/pl/textile/html_css/how_to_draw_stars_using_only_css*/

	/*For all elements with the classes "glow" and "grow"...*/
	.glow.grow {
		/*Apply a transform that rotates them and scales them up (in order to create the desired effect) and translates them in this way to maintain their centered-ness.*/
		transform:rotate(180deg) scale(10) translate(-50%, -50%);
		/*Move the origin around which the shape is transformed in order to keep it centered on the page while the transormation is applied*/
		transform-origin: 0px 25px;
		/*And make any changes to this element take 4 seconds to happen.*/
		transition-duration:4s;

<!-- Create a div with the class "glow" and center it on the page using the "centered" class.-->
<div class="glow centered"></div>

<!-- Create a div to hold your object and center it on the page using the "centered" class.-->
<div id="object" class="centered"></div>

<script>
	// Whenever the #obect div is clicked...
	document.getElementById('object').addEventListener('click', function () {
		// Grab the first (and only) element with the class "glow" and add the class "grow" to it
		document.getElementsByClassName('glow')[0].classList.add('grow');
		// This has the effect of applying the CSS properties assigned to ".glow.grow", which will rotate and grow the star shape over the 4 second transition
