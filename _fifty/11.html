title: Exploding Star
description: Revisiting the circle in <a href="../10">Glow 10</a> got me thinking about other shapes that indicate glowing. Stars! Creating a star, it turns out, is <a href="http://basicuse.net/articles/pl/textile/html_css/how_to_draw_stars_using_only_css">no small task</a> with HTML and CSS. Of course, I could download an image of a star, but part of my goal with this whole project was to push myself as a programmer. I wanted to tackle problems I didn't know how to tackle, and this was one. In this effect, I wanted to place a star behind the object and spin and grow it until the entire background was filled. I implemented the effect by drawing a star, which was created by drawing a triangle using the div's border attributes and then using an :after pseudo-selector, both of which were new to me. Once I had successfully made a star, it proved hard control and move around. The effect I wound up with is a star that spins out from behind the object, growing and moving back to center in a kind of lasso-like effect. It works, but not exactly as I'd hoped. I'd like to return to this effect before all is said and done. <b>TK</b>
