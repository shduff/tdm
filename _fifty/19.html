title: Xerox
description: I wanted to do something playful and fun, so took inspiration from the delightful, 90s movie trope of Xerox-ing things you were never meant to Xerox. A face. A butt. Your favorite ecstatic object. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/xerox.gif"> The glow of a copy machine's light is blinding. It's intense. This effect moves a simple rectangle across the screen, making it glow with a box-shadow, capturing that discrete, linear movement so distinctive of a copy machine. Just for the fun of it, I also added a filter to the object, like in <a href="../8">Glow 8</a>, but this time making the image black and white. To solidify the effect, I added a delay to make sure the grayscale filter was applied as the light passed across the object, transforming the object into a photocopy if itself. All of this as an homage to the black-and-white copier.
