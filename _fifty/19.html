description: I wanted to do something playful and fun, so took inspiration from the delightful, 90s movie trope of Xerox-ing things you were never meant to Xerox. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/xerox.gif"> The glow of a copy machine's light is blinding. It's intense. This effect moves a simple rectable across the screen, making it glow with a box-shadow, capturing that discrete, linear movement so distinctive of a copy mmachine glow. Just for the fun of it, I also added a filter to the object, like in <a href="../8">Glow 8</a>, but this time making the image black and white, adding a delay to make sure the grayscale filter was applied when the light passed across the object, all as an homage to the black-and-white copier.
