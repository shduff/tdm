layout: fifty
title: Glow 1
subtitle: Inspired by the technique I used in my first pancake, this glow effect sets the background image as the original object photo, including the background. When clicked, it slowly transitions to another version of the object photo in which the background has been removed. This gives the effect of the image background glowing as it turns to white behind the object.
