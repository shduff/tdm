description: Inspired by the "natural" glow of Spencer Finch's installation from <a href="../23">Glow 23</a>, I found myself considering other natural light sources. A few years back, I worked with a student team working to design an installation that would give people the full sensory experience of being on a beach at sunrise. This idea was based on one team member's experience in her hometown in Ecuador, a place she was not able to return to in real life but often went in her imagination. The light there, she said, had a particular quality. This idea transformed into the idea of a lamp to which you could upload a photograph. From the photo, it would output a lighting effect which mirrored the color and tone of the picture it was fed. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/ecuador.jpg">  The glow of this sunrise is an homage to that student project, called Helion, and was implemented by using a keyframe animation to control the color change of a linear-gradient set as the page's background image.
