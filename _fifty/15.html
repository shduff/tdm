title: A Field Of Neon Lights In A Mist
description: The field of lights in <a href="../14">Glow 14</a> made an impression on me, but they are only suggestive of a glowing effect and they are still so geometric. In this next glowing field, I revised my first draft to capture the softness of the edges of the light given off by neon. Rather than imagining these lights installed in the crisp, sharp-edged spaces of a gallery, I am instead imagining them in the dark night on a city street. What I love about neon lights is that, no matter the weather, they seem to be in mist. The glow they give off seems almost viscous. Between the movement and shapes and soft edges, I often can't help but imagine neon light is reflecting off of smoke or fog. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/neon-glow.jpg"> This glow effect returns to the box-shadow effect from glows of yore. It attempts to straddle the natural and the man-made, drawing a line between neon and moonlight, mist and smog, trying to capture that almost wet property in the glow of neon.
