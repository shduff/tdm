title: Image Blowout
description: But few of these glow effects are demonstrating subtlety that mirrors the existing light and shadow in the object. They uniformly whiten or make transparent. The CSS filter effect allows us to adjust the brightness of an image, which will give the effect of a glow which blows out brighter spots first, taking longer to impact shadows. This glow effect aims to capture the nuance when glow meets shadow.

	.glow {
		filter:brightness(5000%);
		transition:14s ease-in;
	}
</style>

<div id="object"></div>

<script>
	let object = document.getElementById('object');
	object.addEventListener('click', function() {
		object.classList.add('glow');
	})
