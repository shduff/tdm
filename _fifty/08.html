title: Image Blowout
description: Continuing with the environmental origins from <a href="../7">Glow 7</a>, I wanted to up the realism of my glows. Box-shadow had upped my game from cartoons and simple fading, but few of these glow effects were demonstrating the subtlety light creates when it comes in contact with the existing highlights and shadows of an object. To this point, the effects acted uniformly on the entire object or page. I implemented this effect using CSS filters, which—among other things—allow us to adjust the brightness of an image. It works in the same way as in a traditional photo editing software. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/brightness.jpg"> This glow takes advantage of the photographic mistake called "blowing out" an image, harnessing that mistake as an effect which highlights brighter spots first, taking longer to impact the shadows. This glow effect aims to capture the nuance that occurs when glow meets shadow.
