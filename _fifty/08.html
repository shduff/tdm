title: Image Blowout
description: Continuing with the environmental origins from <a href="../7">Glow 7</a>, I wanted to up the realism of my glows. Box-shadow had upped my game from cartoons and simple fading, but few of these glow effects were demonstrating the subtlety light creates when it comes in contact with the existing highlights and shadows of an object. To this point, the effects acted uniformly on the entire object or page. I implemented this effect using CSS filters, which—among other things—allow us to adjust the brightness of an image. It works in the same way as in a traditional photo editing software. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/brightness.jpg"> This glow takes advantage of the photographic mistake called "blowing out" an image, harnessing that mistake as an effect which highlights brighter spots first, taking longer to impact the shadows. This glow effect aims to capture the nuance that occurs when glow meets shadow.

<style>
	/*For any element with the class "glow"*/
	.glow {
		/*Add a filter that turns the brightness of the element to 5000%, AKA *VERY* bright*/
		filter:brightness(5000%);
		/*Make any change to the element happen over 14 seconds and with an ease in, meaning it goes more slowly at first and speeds up to the end*/
		transition:14s ease-in;
	}
</style>

<!-- Now, create a div to hold your object and center it on the page using the "centered" class.-->
<div id="object" class="centered"></div>

<script>
	// Grab the #object div and call it "object"
	let object = document.getElementById('object');
	// Whenever the #object div id clicked...
	object.addEventListener('click', function() {
		// Give it the class "glow"
		object.classList.add('glow');
		// This has the effect of applying the .glow CSS rules to the #object div, slowly transitioning its brightness to 5000%. Image blowout!
	});
</script>
