title: Image Blowout
description: Continuing with the external glows from <a href="../7">Glow 7</a>, I want to up the realism of my glows. Box-shadow had upped my game from cartoons and simple fading, but few of these glow effects were demonstrating the subtlety actual light creates when it comes in contact with the existing highlights and shadows of an object. To this point, they acted uniformly on the entire object or page. I implemented this effect using CSS filters, which allows us to adjust the brightness of an image. It works in the same way as in a traditional photo editing software. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/brightness.jpg"> It gives the effect of a glow which "blows out" brighter spots first, taking longer to impact shadows and darker bits. This glow effect aims to capture the nuance that occurs when glow meets shadow.
