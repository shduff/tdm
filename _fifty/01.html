title: Fade Between Background Images
description: Inspired by the technique I used in <a href="../../firstpancake">the first pancake that inspired this whole project</a>, this first glow effect works by slowly turning the background around the ecstatic object white. Even though nothing actually glows, the transition from photo background to whiteness creates an impression like the white is shining, radiating through the background. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/bg-no-bg.png"> This effect is implemented by first setting the background image as the original object photo, including the full, original background. When the object is clicked, it slowly transitions to another version of the object photo in which the background has been removed, allowing the white page to come through. This gives the effect of the image background glowing as it turns to white behind the object.
