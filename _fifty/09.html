title: Fade to White Background Image 
description: At this point, I got stuck. I wasn't feeling generative. My eyes were glazed and my head dazed. I looked back at the glow effects I'd done so far and realized there was another way I could use the changing background-image technique all the way back from <a href="../1">Glow 1</a>. While the effect would be similar, a combination of techniques from a few different effects-to-date, the implementation would be different. In this glow, rather than transitioning from an object photo with the full, original background to one the the background removed for an effect that impacts the object's environment, I transitioned from an object photo without a background to a completely white image for an effect that directly impacts the object. By doing this, I effectively moved the origin of the glow outside the object, creating an effect like in Glows <a href="../7">7</a> and <a href="../8">8</a> where the object itself if lost in the radiance of the glow.
