title: Fade to White Background Image 
description: At this point, I got kind of stuck. I wasn't feeling generative. My eyes were glazed and my head dazed. I decided to look back at the glow effects I'd done so far, and, in doing so, realized there was another way I could use the changing background-image technique all the way back from <a href="../1">Glow 1</a>. While the visual effect would be similar, the implementation would be different. In this glow, rather than transitioning from an object photo with the full, original background to one with the background removed for an effect that impacts the object's environment, I transitioned from an object photo without a background to a completely white image for an effect that directly impacts the object. By doing this, I effectively moved the origin of the glow outside the object, creating an effect like in Glows <a href="../7">7</a> and <a href="../8">8</a> in which the object itself is lost in the radiance of the glow.

<style>
	/*For any div with the id "object" and the class "glow"*/
	#object.glow {
		/*Set the background image to be a plain, white image*/
		background-image:url({{site.baseurl}}/media/fifty/white.png);
		/*Make sure the image covers the whole div*/
		background-size:cover;
		/*And make any change to the div take 4 seconds to happen*/
		transition:4s;
	}
</style>

<!-- Now, create a div to hold your object and center it on the page using the "centered" class.-->
<div id="object" class="centered"></div>

<script>
	// Grab the #object div and call it "object"
	let object = document.getElementById('object');
	// Whenever the #object div id clicked...
	object.addEventListener('click', function() {
		// Give it the class "glow"
		object.classList.add('glow');
		// This has the effect of applying the .glow CSS rules to the #object div, slowly transitioning its background-image to white.jpg.
	});
</script>
