title: White Background Image 
description: Feeling a little stuck, I looked back at the earlier glow effects and realized there was another way I could use the changing background-image technique from Glow 1. In this glow, rather than transitioning from an object photo with background to one without for an effect that impacts the object's environment, I transitioned from an object photo without a background to a completely white image for an effect that directly impacts the object.

<style>
	#object.glow {
		background-image:url({{site.url}}/media/fifty/white.png);
		background-size:contain;
		transition:4s;
	}
</style>

<div id="object"></div>

<script>
	let object = document.getElementById('object');
	object.addEventListener('click', function() {
		object.classList.add('glow');
	})
</script>
