title: Fade to White Background Image 
description: At this point, I got kind of stuck. I wasn't feeling generative. My eyes were glazed and my head dazed. I decided to look back at the glow effects I'd done so far, and, in doing so, realized there was another way I could use the changing background-image technique all the way back from <a href="../1">Glow 1</a>. While the visual effect would be similar, the implementation would be different. In this glow, rather than transitioning from an object photo with the full, original background to one with the background removed for an effect that impacts the object's environment, I transitioned from an object photo without a background to a completely white image for an effect that directly impacts the object. By doing this, I effectively moved the origin of the glow outside the object, creating an effect like in Glows <a href="../7">7</a> and <a href="../8">8</a> in which the object itself is lost in the radiance of the glow.
