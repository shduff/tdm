title: Fade From Black Background To White
description: In a slight variation on <a href="../1">Glow 1</a>, this glow effect also utilized the effect of white shining or radiating through a darker brackground. This time, it's implemented by setting the background color of the page to black. When the object is clicked, the background slowly transitions to white. This creates a similar effect, of the image background glowing as it turns to white behind the object.

<style>
	/*Set the background of the page to black.*/
	body {
		background-color:black;
	}
	/*Then, set any elements with class="glow"...*/
	.glow {
		/*to have a white background...*/
		background-color:white;
		/*and to take 5 seconds to make any transitions.*/
		transition-duration:5s;
	}
</style>

<!-- Now, create a div to hold your object and center it on the page using the "centered" class.-->
<div id="object" class="centered"></div>

<script>
	// Whenever your #object div is clicked...
	document.getElementById('object').addEventListener('click', function () {
		// Add the class "glow" to the body of your page.
		document.body.classList.add('glow');
		// When this class is added to the body, it will trigger a background-color change from black to white over a 4 second transition.
	});
</script>
