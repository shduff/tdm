title: Fade From Black Background To White
description: In a slight variation on <a href="../1">Glow 1</a>, this glow effect also utilized the effect of white shining or radiating through a darker brackground. This time, it's implemented by setting the background color of the page to black. When the object is clicked, the background slowly transitions to white. This creates a similar effect, of the image background glowing as it turns to white behind the object.
