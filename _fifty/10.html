title: Shrinking White Circle
description: Still stuck, I looked back at the previous glows again and landed on the cartoonish style of <a href="../3">Glow 3</a>. I decided to implement its inverse, changing it from an effect in which the cartoonish glow emanates outward from the object to one in which it emanates from the environment onto the object. It was a simple enough shift to make in terms of implementation, but it substantially changes the effect and meaning of the glow.
