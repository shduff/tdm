title: Shrinking White Circle
description: Still feeling a bit stuck, I looked back at the previous glows again and landed on the cartoonish style of <a href="../3">Glow 3</a>. I decided to implement its inverse, leaning further onto the environment-as-glow-origin, changing that original effect from one in which the cartoonish glow emanates outward from the object to one in which it emanates from the environment <i>to</i> the object. It was a simple enough shift to make in terms of implementation—inverting the starting and ending sizes for the glow-represented-as-circle—but it substantially changes the effect and meaning of the glow.
