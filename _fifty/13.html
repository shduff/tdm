title: SVG Explosion
description: How else can stars make glows? I was in a flow of free association. In an attempt to find a simpler method of drawing a star than the border-bending tactic from Glows <a href="../11">11</a> and <a href="../12">12</a>, I created an 8 pointed star using the HTML svg tag. Seeing that it looked like a superhero "Pow!" symbol, I decided to create a comic book-style, mirroring the impact of a punch or a miniature explosion. <img width="100%"src="../../media/fifty/pow.png"> Is it a glow? I'd say so. It's at least another symbol or icon representing a lighting effect, one which emanates and explodes, that has light and shadow, an opacity differential, a source, and many of the other characteristics I've been using to explore glow effects thus far.

<script>
	// Whenever the #obect div is clicked...
	document.getElementById('object').addEventListener('click', function () {
		// Grab the first (and only) element with the class "glow" and add the class "grow" to it
		document.getElementsByClassName('glow')[0].classList.add('grow');
		// This has the effect of applying the CSS properties assigned to ".glow.grow", which will rotate and grow the star shape over the 4 second transition
