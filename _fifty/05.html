title: Anti Box Shadow
description: Having gone a bit off the rails with Glows <a href="../3">3</a> and <a href="../4">4</a>, I wanted to return to a more realistic glow with this effect. A glow is a form of light, but it's not just any light. A glow is somehow more and less transparent in different places. There's a misty or almost wet quality to it. In thinking about how I might be able to create this kind of effect on a digital screen, I thought about some of the shadow effects I've seen online. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/box-shadow.png"> This effect is created using the box-shadow property in CSS. To implement this glow effect, I used the box-shadow property, inverting the colors traditionally used to create shadows (dark shadow on light background) to <a href="https://codersblock.com/blog/creating-glow-effects-with-css/">make a glow</a> (light "shadow" on dark background). In this way, I was able to create a subtle, more authentic, glowing effect which was still building on the circle-in-back structure I'd already established by utilizing the difference in opacity, or transparency, glows have IRL.

<style>
	/*Set the background of the page to black.*/
	body {
		background-color:black;
	}
	/*For any element with the id "object"*/
	#object {
		/*Elements with larger z-indexes are "on top of" elements with smaller z-indexes.*/
		z-index:10;
	}
	/*For any element with the class "glow"*/
	.glow {
		/*This z-index value means elements with class="glow" (z-index=5) will be "behind" elements with id="object" (z-index=10).*/
		z-index:5;
		/*Set the size of .glow elements based on height and width...*/
		height:20em;
		width:20em;
		/*Make it a circle...*/
		border-radius:50%;
		/*And make any change to this element happen over 3 seconds*/
	    transition:3s;
	}
</style>

<!-- Create a div called "glow" and center it on the page using the "centered" class. -->
<div class="glow centered"></div>
<!-- Now, create a div to hold your object and center it on the page using the "centered" class.-->
<div id="object" class="centered"></div>

<script>
	// Whenever the #object div is clicked...
	document.getElementById('object').addEventListener('click', function () {
		// Grab the first (and only) .glow div from the page and apply a box-shadow to it with these properties
		document.getElementsByClassName('glow')[0].style.boxShadow = '0em 0em 25em 15em beige';
		// Because the background of the page is dark and the box-shadow is lighter, the effect is of a glow rather than a shadow. I found this technique using this write-up: https://codersblock.com/blog/creating-glow-effects-with-css/
