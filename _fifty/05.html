title: Anti Box Shadow
description: Having gone a bit off the rails with Glows <a href="../3">3</a> and <a href="../4">4</a>, I wanted to return to a more realistic glow with this effect. A glow is a form of light, but it's not just any light. A glow is somehow more and less transparent in different places. There's a misty or almost wet quality to it. In thinking about how I might be able to create this kind of effect on a digital screen, I thought about some of the shadow effects I've seen online. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/box-shadow.png"> This effect is created using the box-shadow property in CSS. To implement this glow effect, I used the box-shadow property, inverting the colors traditionally used to create shadows (dark shadow on light background) to <a href="https://codersblock.com/blog/creating-glow-effects-with-css/">make a glow</a> (light "shadow" on dark background). In this way, I was able to create a subtle, more authentic, glowing effect which was still building on the circle-in-back structure I'd already established by utilizing the difference in opacity, or transparency, glows have IRL.
