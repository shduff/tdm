title: Claustrophobic Box Shadow
description: This glow continues to build on the box-shadow effect from Glows <a href="../6">6</a> and <a href="../7">7</a>, deploying it in a new way. Excepting Glows <a href="../1">1</a> and <a href="../2">2</a>, the glow effects I've implemented thus far have siruated the source of the glow within the ecstatic object itself. In this effect, the environmment becomes the source, and the object is overcome by a glow emanating from all around it. It is implemented by placing small rectangles just outside the visible screen, using them to grow the blur and spread of their box-shadows when the object is clicked. This effect gives the impression that the glow is coming from the environment, like a flash or explosion, like a comet or a bomb. This glow has come from afar and is overtaking the object with its brilliance.

<!-- Now, create a div to hold your object and center it on the page using the "centered" class.-->
<div id="object" class="centered"></div>
<!-- Along with a div each with the ids "top", "right", "bottom", and "left" -->
<div id="top"></div>
<div id="right"></div>
<div id="bottom"></div>
<div id="left"></div>

<script>
	// Whenever the #object div is clicked...
	document.getElementById('object').addEventListener('click', function() {
		// Then, grab each of the divs with the ids "top", "right", "bottom", and "left". Add the class "glow" to each one.
		document.getElementById('top').classList.add('glow');
		document.getElementById('bottom').classList.add('glow');
		document.getElementById('left').classList.add('glow');
		document.getElementById('right').classList.add('glow');
		// By adding this class to each div, you are adding its CSS assigned to each div, which adds a large white box-shadow to each div. For the "top" and "bottom" divs, the box-shadow is added over 3 seconds. For the "right" and "left" divs, it's added over 3 seconds. In a rectangular screen, this has the effect of making the glow seem like it's coming from all sides at the same speed.
