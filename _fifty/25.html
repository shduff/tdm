title: Lightning
description: Continuing with the natural lighting effects from the past few glows, this effect was inspired by lightning. It aims to capture the way lightning is at once overpowering and soft-edged, how it seems to start with a soft glow, increasing quickly in brilliance until it fills the sky, then decreasing in intensity to another brief, soft glow before disappearing again. A periodic, gentle change in the opacity of the object creates the ominous sense of darkness and depth that can follow a lightning flash, the on-edge dread you feel as you wait for the next boom of thunder to come. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/lightning.gif"> Using a similar technique to the sunrise in <a href="../24">Glow 24</a>, this effect is implemented using a keyframe animation that changes the background color of the page, controlling the timing of that change to mimic the color and tone of lightning as it flashes through the sky.
