title: A Field Of Neon Lights
description: In looking at the boxy shapes from the past few glows, I felt like I was getting stuck in the realm of geometric shapes. I found myself trying to think about other shapes and forms that could suggest and represent glows. I wanted to move away from icons in the cartoon and comic direction, and somehow found myself thinking about the somewhat niche world-within-the-contemporary-art-world that uses neon lights as its medium. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/neon-art.jpg"> Unlike many of the installations that inspired it, which bend and twist their neon, this glow effect is meant to behave, in shape and form, as a field of strip lights. Rather than acting in the wonderful ways neon can, they are straight and tubular, suggestive of fluourescent lighting, the worst kind of office glow. As individual elements, these "lights" aren't much, but as a collection they are making a statement. I could imagine this collection installed on a large wall, moving to and fro, casting a soft, glowing illumination into a gallery room.
