title: The Search
description: Riffing on the spot effect from <a href="../17">Glow 17</a>, I decided to create an adaptation that would use the same visual effect to elicit a very different meaning, transforming stage lights into search lights. Utilizing the same semi-transparent triangles, I implemented keyframe animations that moved the triangles around an origin point set at the tallest corner of each triangle. By moving each light in this way, rotating them around this particular point and creating a specific kind of cadence, they appear to be in pursuit, moving like the search lights in spy movies and police dramas to find a very special object. The spot and search lights seem to share some of the wet, glowing effects of neon, seeming to stain the air with their glow, as if their light were physical like paint.
