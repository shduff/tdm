title: Pulsating Anti Box Shadow
description: Satisfied with the subtle effect from <a href="../5">Glow 5</a>, I wanted to build on it further. I asked myself, "What else can a glow do?" Sure, a glow is light. It has different opacities. It has qualities of mist and wetness. Sure, it can grow, expand, and emanate. But what <i>else</i> can it do? Well, it can also pulsate. This effect is a variant on the last which pulses with the potential energy trapped inside of it. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/lightsaber.gif"> This effect is meant to capture the type of glow that emanates from powerful objects, from monoliths and holy grails and other sacred symbols which, rather than exploding with radiance, hum and buzz with the constraint of their own power.
