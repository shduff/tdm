title: Pulsating Anti Box Shadow
description: Satisfied with the subtle effect from <a href="../5">Glow 5</a>, I wanted to build on it further. I asked myself, "What else can a glow do?" Sure, a glow is light. It has different opacities. It has qualities of mist and wetness. Sure, it can grow, expand, and emanate. But what <i>else</i> can it do? Well, it can also pulsate. This effect is a variant on the last which pulses with the potential energy trapped inside of it. This is meant to capture the type of glow emenating from powerful objects, from monoliths and holy grails and other sacred objects which hum with buzz of their own power rather than exploding with radiance. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/lightsaber.gif">
