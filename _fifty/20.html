title: Glowing Butt
description: I'd been working from man-made inspirations for a while, so decided to move back to the natural world. Nature offers an infinity of glows, but I chose the firefly. In this glow effect, I wanted to create the effect of a small, single glowing creature moving around the environment. It wouldn't overtake the object, and the object wouldn't overtake it. It would simply exist, moving around the environment like a firefly caught in the jar of this webpage. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/firefly.gif"> I implemented this effect by creating a small, oval-shapped div, giving it ye olde box-shadow, and then setting it's fixed-position to random distances from the top and right of the page, making sure the numbers generated were never larger than the overall height and width of the page. Tada! Firefly. In this description, however, I realized I never checked my animation against actual fireflies, which blink! Gotta return to this one... <b>TK</b>
