title: The Spots
description: In thinking about the effect from <a href="../16">Glow 16</a> and its inspiration, I found myself thinking about other kinds of man-made, indoor light used to create glowing effects in theater settings. Theater performances are rife with lighting effects, but one presented itself as my obvious next glow. The spot light. This effect was implemented by returning to the triangle drawing from Glows <a href="../11">11</a> and <a href="../12">12</a>, lowering their opacity and overlapping their beams to create a spotlight-like effect. This effect is my digital homage to the glow of the spots.
