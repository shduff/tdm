title: Growing White Circle
description: Still thinking with the color pallete of <a href="../2">Glow 2</a>, this glow effect takes on more of an iconic style. (Think phone icons, not Taj Mahal.) Rather than aiming to create an authentic rendering of a glow, one which captures an actual change in lighting, this effect aims to create the effect of a Looney Tunesâ„¢ outro or cartoon-style glow. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/looney.jpg"> It's implemented by drawing a small white circle and then hiding it behind the object. When the object is clicked, the circle begins to grow and continues to do so until it takes over the entire screen. This circle symbolizes a glow more than it seeks to actually capture the essence of one.

<!-- Create a div called "glow" and center it on the page using the "centered" class. -->
<div class="glow centered"></div>
<!-- Now, create a div to hold your object and center it on the page using the "centered" class.-->
<div id="object" class="centered"></div>

<script>
	// Whenever your #object div is clicked...
	document.getElementById('object').addEventListener('click', function () {
		// Grab the first element with the class "glow" and add the class "grow" to it.
		document.getElementsByClassName('glow')[0].classList.add('grow');
		// We know there is only one .glow element, so this has the effect of increasing the .glow element's height and width, transitioning its size over the 3 seconds set in the CSS rules it acquires along with its new .grow class.
