description: In a variation of <a href="../11">Glow 11</a> and inspired by the movement I'd created while unable to get the star to move how I'd hoped, I wanted to use a star in a different kind of glow effect. The first star effect was based on the idea that a star, quite literally, glows. But stars also have <i>symbolic</i> meanings connected with <i>metaphorical</i> glows. For this effect, I created a five-pointed (much more involved than a six-pointed!) star and reused the not-quite-what-I'd-wanted movement from the previous effect to create a Hollywood Walk of Fame style star. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/walk-of-fame.jpg"> In this effect, the glow is less literal and more about the glow of recognition, fame, legacy. In this effect, the out-and-back movement of the star feels right. It's a gold star review. It's making an entrance. It's marking the object's success. Go get it, ecstatic object!
