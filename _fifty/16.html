title: Homage To James Turrell
description: With contemporary art on the brain after Glows <a href="../14">14</a> and <a href="../15">15</a>, I was reminded of a series of light installations I saw at Mass MOCA, created by James Turrell. One in particular, called <a href="https://massmoca.org/event/james-turrell/">Into the Light</a>, was an installation in which Turrell creates a perfectly white room with no hard edges. <img width="100%" src="../../media/fifty/turrell.jpg"> You had to wear little booties to avoid scuffing the floors. There were no corners, floor melting into wall. He sets up a series of projectors which cast light about in such a way that the room itself seems to glow, color melting into color, your sense of space and direction melting into eachother as time passes. In this effect, I used a keyframe animation to change the colors of a linear-gradient background to recreate the glowing, color-changing effect of Into The Light.
