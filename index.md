Inspired by Vi Hart's <a href="http://vihart.com/fifty-fizzbuzzes/">50 Fizzbuzzes</a> and Rosalie Norris' <a href="https://www.notion.so/powderhouse/Tiny-Digital-Masterpieces-96d5d2c001e24ecfac1a8334d52d5b1b">Tiny Digital Masterpieces</a>, Go With The Glow is a collection of 50 tiny digital masterpieces capturing the implied movement of "the glow effect"â€”the one that is often accompanied by a choral vocalization, to make an object seem sacred, come from heaven, bestowed upon the receiverâ€”in 50 different waysâ€”to push my computational thinking and programming skills as I figure out fifty ways to do the "same" thing.
